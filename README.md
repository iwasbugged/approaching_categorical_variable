**What is categorical variable?**

Categorical variable/features are any feature type can be classified into two major types:
- Nominal
- Ordinal
**Nominal varibles** are variables that have two or more categories which do not have any kind of order associate with them. For example , if gender is classified into two groups , i.e male and female , it can be considered as a nominal variable.

**Ordinal variable** , on the other hand, have "levels" or categories with a particular order associated with them. For example , an ordinal categorical variable can be a feature with three different levels: low , medium and high . Order is important.

As far as definition is concern ,  we can also categorize categorical variables as **binary** , i.e., a categorical variable with only two categories.  Some even talk about a type called **"cycle"** for categorical variables.  Cycle variables are present in "cycles" for example, days ina week : After Saturday , we have Sunday again .  this is a cycle . another example would be hours in a day if we consider them to be categories.

we will be using Kaggle's dataset called **"cat-in-the-dat"**
